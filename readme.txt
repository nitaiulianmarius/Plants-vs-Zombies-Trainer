1. Start the game - Plants vs Zombies
2. Start the trainer
3. Set how many suns you want. 

Also you can enjoy the trainer downloading it from github release folder https://github.com/nitaiulianmarius

May become unusable due to game updates, but still a good starting point once you got memory addresses. I used Cheat Engine.
